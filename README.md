# ReHear
An audio accessibility app for those who may sometimes miss things.

##WARNING PROTOTYPE
This app is currently in the prototype phase.

##Overview
This app is designed for people who sometimes miss things or mishear things
 in conversations, or in everyday life.  It is designed to be a simple 'replay button' so the user
can quickly and easily replay the previous 30 seconds of audio.

While activated the software will constantly monitor the microphone of the device keeping a buffer of 30 seconds anddiscarding the rest.  If the user needs to repeat the audio they will press a button that repeats the audio.  They can choose to play the audio at 1/2 speed or with speech enhancement filters.  When they want to move on, they can choose to either keep the audio and continue or delete it.  The default is to delete the audio.

This software was requested and inspired by my father who's mother suffered from progressive deafness in old age.  I write it for him and my mother in the hope that we don't need it, but that if we do, it may be useful.  Thanks for everything folks.
